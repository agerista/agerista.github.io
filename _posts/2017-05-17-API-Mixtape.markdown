# API Mixtape 

Below are summaries and thoughts on the talks from the event.

## Your API Is Bad and You Should Feel Bad

The first talk of the day was by Amanda Folson, she spoke to us about the importance
of creating a consistent experience and a contiguous eco-system. How do you do 
that? By taking a design first approach. When you are creating an API, you should
get out a piece of paper and map out end points so that they make sense. Really, 
a piece of paper, like when you were in school, it is better than a computer for
organizing your thoughts and creating a solid user experience.

So how do you go about creating a design first API? By asking yourself a lot of 
questions of course. Who is your audience? What are they using it for? You can
come up with more relevant questions on your own, but you should definitely spend
your time here so that you can create an amazing API that people want to use.

The other strong piece of advice that Amanda gave us was to think a lot about your
error codes. The more descriptive your error codes are, the better your user 
experience will be. For example a bad request shouldn't leave a user wondering
what the problem is. Give your user the information that they need, like $field
required, so that they know why the request is bad.

Remember, it's not always 200 ok! Use descriptive error codes and have good 
documentation.


## In search of the 'Goldilocks' API

Calvin French posited that API's are not how computer systems communicate, protocols
are, API's are the contract that make it happen.
