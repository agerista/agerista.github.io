        <h6>Solo Project</h6>
        <p>About a year ago, I bought a car, which opened a world of hiking 
          opportunities outside of the city. With all of these opportunities, 
          came the problem of looking up weather, trails, and yelp reviews 
          separately to figure out where to go hiking that day. This project was 
          the perfect opportunity to solve that problem.</p>

        <h6>All-Women Hackathon Group Project</h6>
        <p>Good Streets is intended to address the issue of women's safety. 
          We mapped out recent crime data on a map of San Francisco. In keeping 
          with out empowerment focus, we also plotted out Safe Havens that women 
          could use if they were feeling unsafe. To top it all off, we plotted 
          out pro-active resources like self-defense classes that would increase 
          future feelings of safety. And of course, the app can be used by anyone 
          concerned with their safety!</p>

        <p>The goal is that someone could open the app, see that the current area 
          is a little unsafe, and choose a safer walking route, or duck into a 
          safe haven and call a Lyft.</p>

        <h6>Solo Project</h6>
        <p>Text-based adventure game, an exercise from Learn Python the Hard Way. 
          Aliens have invaded a space ship and our hero has to go through a maze 
          of rooms defeating them so he can escape into an escape pod to the planet 
          below. The game will be more like a Zork or Adventure type game with text 
          outputs and funny ways to die. The game will involve an engine that runs 
          a map full of rooms or scenes. Each room will print its own description 
          when the player enters it and then tell the engine what room to run next 
          out of the map.</p>
