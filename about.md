I am a recent graduate of [Hackbright Academy](http://www.hackbrightacademy.com). Before attending Hackbright, I was a Fitness Consultant, managing fitness studios, teaching teachers how to teach, and teaching many different genres of classes. I also piloted an [online yoga class]
(https://www.facebook.com/SculptStream/). That class lead me to think about how to reach out to more people to change their lives through fitness. 

Around the same time, I was introduced to programming through the Hour of Code. It quickly became clear that coding could be the answer to my reach problem. I followed my curiosity through many tutorials and online classes and ended up at Hackbright. 

During my time at Hackbright, I developed a love of databases, data structures and recursion. I am excited to continue learning new technologies and to strengthen my current skills in my new job as a full stack engineer.

Interests: finding the best cafe, collecting plants, wondering around art museums
